## Take a look inside MinaLima’s new twenty-year celebration book
- The graphic design duo behind the Harry Potter and Fantastic Beasts films have a beautiful new book coming out, looking back at over two decades of behind-the-scenes creations across the Wizarding World. Let’s take a look inside.

Entitled The Magic of MinaLima: Celebrating the Graphic Design Studio Behind the Harry Potter & Fantastic Beasts Films, the design team’s latest publication goes more personal than you’ve seen before, revealing a scrapbook of letters that the designers sent to each other in the beginning, alongside concept art pieces and research documents that would lead to some of the most iconic props in the Wizarding World stories.

From the Hogwarts acceptance letter (handwritten by one half of the MinaLima duo, Mira) to the Daily Prophet newspapers, this gorgeously detailed compendium leaves no stone unturned when it comes to the meticulous level of thinking that went behind the magical objects you see in the Harry Potter and Fantastic Beasts films. Each page is an explosion of colour and imagination, as you can see here.

If you’re a budding artist looking for an inspirational story, this book certainly contains many.
